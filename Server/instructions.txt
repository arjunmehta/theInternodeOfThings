Install node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
Once installed, open terminal to this directory and run

node app.js /dev/yourSerialPortName
eg. node app.js /dev/tty.usbmodem411

It should work, but you may need to install all the dependencies and extensions first. I don't actually know :(

Connect a web client/browser to localhost:3000
Connect your Arduino.

When new serial information is written from the Arduino to the serialport, the server will transmit it to all connected clients.


------


To set this up from scratch, Terminal commands as follows:

mkdir nodeExpressSerial
cd nodeExpressSerial/
npm install express
express
npm install -d
npm install now
npm install serialport

You'll have a virgin app.js file without any of the serial port read, or now.js stuff working.
